	<h1>COSECHA</h1>
	<p><i>Status: development</i></p>
	<p>Farming is knowledge intensive activity. At Nybrukarna we run a weekly CSA and sell to wholesalers, coordinating 5 growers with different fields and planting more than 25 different vegetables and different varieties of them and following different crop rotation based on plant family, nutrient needs and weed pressure. Planning planting space, seed amount and timing to provide right quantities at the right time can get quite complicated!</p>
	<p>Cosecha (harvest in Spanish) is a prototype to test how technology can help in the planning, and also in the economic simulation of the impact of planting different crops. The idea is to do not overcomplicate things, with the motto do not digitalize something that is easier to do in paper (for example crop rotations).</p>
	<h3>Prototype 001</h3>
	<img src="http://greenhackathon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/photo-4.png">
	<p>A small prototype using jQuery created during the <a href="http://ict4s.greenhackathon.com" target="_blank">2014 Green Hackathon</a>. The idea was to calculate amount of produce and return by playing with the amount of rows of different vegetable in the same field. <a href="https://github.com/zapico/cosecha">Available at github</a></p>
	<h3>Prototype 002</h3>
	<p>A more data complex planning using Excel designed to be used for planning and seed amount calculation.</p>
